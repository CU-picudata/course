*What to do with your data, not just how to do it*

*This cannot replace formal Biostatistics and Epidemiology courses*


### Biostatistics

- [Stanford Statistics in Medicine](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Medicine/MedStats-SP/SelfPaced/about)
    - theoretical, with optional applications in R

### Epidemiology

- [UNC Epidemiology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemiology)
    - mixed reviews but a reasonable introduction
