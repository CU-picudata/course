### Google! 

- The answer is likely to be immediately available
- example: copy the error message into the search bar
- example: "how to install RStudio on a Mac"

### If Google can't save you: open an issue [here](https://github.com/CU-picudata/course)

- Near top of page, "Issues" tab
- I am doing this (instead of email) so that everyone can benefit from questions and answers. Therefore, if you send me email I will ask you to open (or comment on) an issue instead. 
- Example issue title: "reading in string variables using `readr`"
- Example issue text: "How do I tell `readr` which variables are strings and which are integers?"
- Anyone can comment on an issue. Huge bonus points if a classmate (politely) answers your question.
